# Nyquist

My layout for the Levinson (amputated Nyquest).  Mostly inspired by / pilfered from the default PlanckEZ (RIP) and the Ultimate Hacking Keyboard.

Notable points:
* See keymap.c for actual layout.
* QWERTY, for my sins.
* Lower (layer 1) /Raise (layer 2) keys, respectively, below V and M, as typically on Planck.  Additionally a navigation layer 4, below C, and a mouse layer 5 below B.  Space below N.
* No Enter key in base layer, so LSFT left of Z and RSFT right of /. The right shift key becomes Enter in layer 1, as does the space.
* The frequently remapped caps-lock/esc is in this case ALT, so you get two of those.  It becomes ESC again in layer 2.
* RHS and upper row of lower (1) is basically the Planck symbol layer; some mouse button keys on the LHS, loosely following UHK.  The ctrl-mouse on V is particularly handy in IntelliJ.
* Raise (2) is basically the Planck number layer.
* Layer 3 follows the UHK navigation cluster, with arrow keys on JKL and I.
* Layer 4 follows the UHK mouse conventions; same inverted T as navigation.

Layer 4 is only built if you have an rp2040 (as in rev4 of the board_.
